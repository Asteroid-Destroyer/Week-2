I created a new power bi document and imported the file then loaded it on it and cleaned the Datas then transformed the data by changing the types, rounding off decimals, removed columns, reordered columns and uppercased text and did this to all the duplicate tables created inventory, supplier and manufacture table  and at last close and apply then got to the relationship part where deleted and created relationship and created a one to many relationship.
